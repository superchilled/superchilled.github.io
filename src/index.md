My name is Karl. I'm a developer advocate with a background in design, development, and developer education. Currently working at [Vonage](https://developer.vonage.com/en/home).

I enjoy learning new things, building stuff on the web, and sharing knowledge. I'm based in North Wales, and in my spare time I love exploring the outdoors, especially the mountains of [Eryri](https://snowdonia.gov.wales/).

If you want to say 'hey', you can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/KarlLingiah) or get in touch with me at [hey@karl-lingiah.net](mailto:hey@karl-lingiah.net?subject=hey%20karl).
